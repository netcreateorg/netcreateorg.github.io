### How to use Net.Create to Make Networks

Our [user guide](/netcreate-userdocs/) provides basic information on how to add and edit nodes and edges and how to "read" the network "graph" or visualization.

### Installation

#### The Command-line Version

Net.Create is built on a Node.JS, React and D3 core and uses npm to manage its packages. If you've got a computer running MacOS (or you're willing to invest $5/month in a Digital Ocean droplet), are comfortable with command line work (or willing to experiment), have admin control over your computer, and have a basic understanding of GitHub, check out the source code at [https://github.com/netcreateorg/netcreate-itest/](https://github.com/netcreateorg/netcreate-itest/).

<p><a class="button tiny radius" href="https://github.com/netcreateorg/netcreate-itest/wiki/Installation-Guide">Documentation for Installation</a></p>

<!--Our [installation documentation](/documentation) is a work in progress but it provides [basic tutorials for new-to-the-command-line users, a full set of installation instructions for [MacOS](http://netcreate.org/documentation/#if-your-personal-computer-is-a-mac) and [Digital Ocean](http://netcreate.org/documentation/#if-your-personal-computer-is-a-windowslinux-machine), and instructions for creating user-access tokens.-->

#### The Easy Version (Coming Soon)

We're in the process of working through requirements for a 1-click install version of Net.Create at Digital Ocean. If you want to be notified of Net.Create news, please let us know through our [Contact Form](/contact/)
