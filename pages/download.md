### The Easy Version (Coming Soon)
We're in the process of working through requirements for a downloadable double-clickable version of Net.Create. If you want to be notified of Net.Create news, please let us know through our [Contact Form](/contact/)
### The Command-line Version

Net.Create is built on a Node.JS, React and D3 core and uses npm to manage its packages. If you've got a computer running MacOS, are comfortable with command line work (or willing to experiment), have admin control over your computer, and have a basic understanding of GitHub, you can fork the repo at [http://github.com/netcreateorg/netcreate-2018/](http://github.com/netcreateorg/netcreate-2018/)
