### The Command-line Version

Net.Create is built on a Node.JS, React and D3 core and uses npm to manage its packages. If you've got a computer running MacOS (or you're willing to invest $5/month in a Digital Ocean droplet), are comfortable with command line work (or willing to experiment), have admin control over your computer, and have a basic understanding of GitHub, check out the source code at [http://github.com/netcreateorg/netcreate-2018/](http://github.com/netcreateorg/netcreate-2018/).
