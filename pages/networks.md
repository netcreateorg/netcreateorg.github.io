In Spring of 2019, 75 students built a network using [Tacitus' Annals](https://www.amazon.com/Annals-Reigns-Tiberius-Claudius-Classics/dp/019282421X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Tacitus+the+annals+oxford&qid=1558379850&s=gateway&sr=8-1), with a focus on the chronicles of the Roman Emperors Claudius and Nero. These three sample networks are all based on a single network built by students over 2 network-building sessions of approximately 35 minutes each.

- [The original network produced by students](/SampleNetworks/2019-02-06_Tacitus/#/?ROME-FEB-LQN-ID008&TRACK=NO)
    - This shows Nero and Claudius at the center of their imperial courts, with nodes divided into "Person", "Group", "Place", "Thing", and "Event".
- [The original network produced by students with added gender distinctions](/SampleNetworks/2019-02-06_TacitusGender/#/?ROME-FEB-LQN-ID008&TRACK=NO)
    - After students generated their original network, the instructional team used Net.Create **live during class** to reassign nodes with the "Person" label into "Man" and "Woman" categories.
    - The instructor's goal was to explore the role women played in connecting members of the Roman Imperial court and its functions.
    - Students noted that women connected important people despite not making a lot of connections themselves (eigenvector centrality rather than degree centrality).
- [The original network produced by students with added factions](/SampleNetworks/2019-02-06_TacitusModularity/#/?ROME-FEB-LQN-ID008&TRACK=NO)
    - While the students were discussing the newly-generated gender network, a member of the instructional team exported data to Gephi and ran a modularity/network-neighborhood report.
    - That information was reimported to Net.Create **live during class** so that students could see divisions in the imperial network. We briefly discussed factions and then students explored the faction network on their own after class.
