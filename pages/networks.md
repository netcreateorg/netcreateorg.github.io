## Research-Driven Net.Create Example Networks

- Dr. Catherine Mullen's project on *The Power of the Popular* examines the practices of Manchester Digital Music Archive (MDMA), a volunteer-run and user-generated community archive that aims to celebrate and preserve music from Greater Manchester, the large metropolitan area including and surrounding the city of Manchester, England. Dr. Mullen used Net.Create to explore larger networks of heritage work and popular music preservation in Manchester, which are visible in Figures 5-9 at [https://camullenphd.github.io](https://camullenphd.github.io)
- In Spring of 2019, undergraduate researchers worked with the Indiana University Bloomington community and networked community contributions to a History Harvest--a public digital history of IU's campus--using several different network taxonomies at [https://historyharvest.indiana.edu/Fall2019/stories/Networks.html](https://historyharvest.indiana.edu/Fall2019/stories/Networks.html).

## In-classroom Net.Create Example Networks

- In Spring of 2019, 75 students built a network using [Tacitus' Annals](https://www.amazon.com/Annals-Reigns-Tiberius-Claudius-Classics/dp/019282421X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Tacitus+the+annals+oxford&qid=1558379850&s=gateway&sr=8-1), with a focus on the chronicles of the Roman Emperors Claudius and Nero. These three sample networks are all based on a single network built by students over 2 network-building sessions of approximately 35 minutes each.
	- [The original network produced by students](/SampleNetworks/2019-02-06_Tacitus/#/?ROME-FEB-LQN-ID008&TRACK=NO)
		- This shows Nero and Claudius at the center of their imperial courts, with nodes divided into "Person", "Group", "Place", "Thing", and "Event".
	- [The original network produced by students with added gender distinctions](/SampleNetworks/2019-02-06_TacitusGender/#/?ROME-FEB-LQN-ID008&TRACK=NO)
		- After students generated their original network, the instructional team used Net.Create **live during class** to reassign nodes with the "Person" label into "Man" and "Woman" categories.
		- The instructor's goal was to explore the role women played in connecting members of the Roman Imperial court and its functions.
		- Students noted that women connected important people despite not making a lot of connections themselves (eigenvector centrality rather than degree centrality).
	- [The original network produced by students with added factions](/SampleNetworks/2019-02-06_TacitusModularity/#/?ROME-FEB-LQN-ID008&TRACK=NO)
		- While the students were discussing the newly-generated gender network, a member of the instructional team exported data to Gephi and ran a modularity/network-neighborhood report.
		- That information was reimported to Net.Create **live during class** so that students could see divisions in the imperial network. We briefly discussed factions and then students explored the faction network on their own after class.
